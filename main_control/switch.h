 * 
 * A libary for managing a series of switches used to controll several aspect of the elevator.
 * 
 * Need the 10 pins to conect to as input on the constructor
 * 
 * All buttons are refered to as the index of the inputed list
 * Use SwitchButtonPressed for a TRUE when the button has been pressed and are released
 * Use whileButtonPressed for a TRUE as long as the button are pressed down
 * Use switchCase for a swtich between True/False is th button are presed and released again
 * 
 * This libay requires: arduino
